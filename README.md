Implementation of the Blackjack card game in Kotlin.
## Standard Blackjack rules:
- Number cards are counted by their face value.
- Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are each worth 10.
- Aces can be worth either 1 or 11.
- Each player starts with two cards.
- Players may draw additional cards as long as their total remains 21 or less.
- The dealer must draw a card if their total is 16 or less, and must stand on 17 or more.
- If the dealer busts (goes over 21), all remaining players automatically win.
- After the game ends, display the result (win/loss) for each player.
