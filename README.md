# Kotlin Blackjack
Welcome to my simple Black Jack game in Kotlin. I have implemented 
an interactive card game following the original rules. Players can also bet
some money.

## Rules
Each player must place a bet at the start of the game. <br/>
Card values follow standard Blackjack rules: <br/>
Number cards are counted by their face value.<br/>
Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are each worth 10.<br/>
Aces can count as either 1 or 11.<br/>
Players are dealt two cards at the beginning of the game.<br/>
Players can choose to draw additional cards as long as their total does not exceed 21.<br/>
If a player draws a card and the total exceeds 21, they lose their entire bet.<br/>
If a player hits 21 with the initial two cards (Blackjack), they receive 1.5x their bet.<br/>
If both the player and dealer have Blackjack, the player’s bet is returned.<br/>
The dealer must draw an additional card if their initial total is 16 or less.<br/>
The dealer must stand on 17 or more.<br/>
If the dealer busts (exceeds 21), all remaining players automatically win and receive payouts based on their bets.<br/>

## State Pattern
This project allows us to implement the so-called State Pattern
and therefore eliminate scattered and excessive conditionals.

Since the game by nature provides states: hit, busted, blackjack, etc. it makes sense to use this pattern for our game.
The State Pattern holds:
1. State Interface 
2. Concrete States 
3. Context (game logic)

## Features
States
- [x] Hit
  - has to decide if "y" or "n"
  - <= 21 for player (can)
  - <= 16 for dealer (must)
  - {ACTION}
  - -> Hit or Bust or Stay
- [x] Bust 
  - goes over 21
  - {STOP}
- [x] Init 
  - has to draw 2 cards
  - {ACTION}
  - -> Hit
- [x] BlackJack 
  - has exactly 21 with 2 cards
  - {STOP}
- [x] Stay
  - has <= 21, but decided to stop
  - {STOP}

Context
- [x] set betting amount for each player
  - [x] positive Int

## Results
  | Implemented | **Situation**                                     | **Winner** | **Explanation**                                                     |
  |-------------| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | y           | Player gets blackjack, dealer doesn't             | Player     | Blackjack (Ace + 10) pays 3:2 or 6:5, depending on rules            |
  | y           | Dealer gets blackjack, player doesn't             | Dealer     | Dealer wins unless the player also has blackjack (then it's a push) |
  | y           | Both player and dealer get blackjack              | Push (tie) | No one wins, player's bet is returned                               |
  | y           | Player busts (goes over 21)                       | Dealer     | Automatic loss for the player regardless of dealer's hand           |
  | y           | Dealer busts, player doesn't                      | Player     | Dealer loses automatically if over 21                               |
  | y           | Neither busts, player's hand > dealer's           | Player     | Closest to 21 without busting wins                                  |
  | y           | Neither busts, dealer's hand > player's           | Dealer     | Dealer wins if they are closer to 21                                |
  | y           | Player and dealer have same total (not blackjack) | Push (tie) | No one wins, bet is returned                                        |


## Sample Output

pobi,jason

Enter pobi’s betting amount:
10000
